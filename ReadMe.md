# Imperial Weather

A weather app that displays the current temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius at the same time.

*Frameworks: SwiftUI, CoreLocation, URLSession, Codable, Result*

## Why I Made This

I moved from the US to the UK and consequently switched from using Fahrenheit to Celsius. I wanted to “learn” the Celsius scale by seeing equivalent Fahrenheit temperatures side-by-side.

## My Approach

The app displays current weather and hourly and daily temperatures for the user’s current location. 

I deliberately kept functionality simple. Side-by-side temperatures for my current location was enough to solve my problem. Once I had that working, I wanted to spend time include error handling and decompose and organize the view hierarchy, view modifiers and formatted values as a learning experience.
