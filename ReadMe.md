# Imperial Weather

A weather app that displays temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius side-by-side.

Itâ€™s built with **SwiftUI**, **SwiftCharts**, **CoreLocation**, **Codable** and data from OpenWeather. 

[Read about the app, my approach and learning experience](https://phillipbaker.me/imperial-weather/) on my website.
