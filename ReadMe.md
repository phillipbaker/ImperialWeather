# Imperial Weather

A weather app that displays temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius side-by-side. 

The app shows current and upcoming temperatures in both scales. A toggle switches the primary scale. 

Itâ€™s built with **SwiftUI**, **SwiftCharts**, **CoreLocation**, **Codable** and data from OpenWeather.

[Read about the app, my approach and learning experiences](https://phillipbaker.me/imperial-weather/) on my website.
