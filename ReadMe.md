# Imperial Weather

A weather app that displays the current and upcoming temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius at the same time.

I moved from the US to the UK and switched from using Fahrenheit to Celsius. I wanted to learn the Celsius scale by seeing the temperature in both scales side-by-side.

The app displays current and upcoming temperatures for users’ current location, with a segmented control to switch the primary scale.

I’ve written more about my approach, learnings and future development plans on my [website](https://phillipbaker.me/imperial-weather/).
